	    <h4>Working with Children and Parents</h4>
			<p>Working with children is one of my passions.
				My philosophy in working with children is that I help the child feel that he/she is a unique individual
				worthy of love, respect, and nurturing. I help children feel safe by providing them with a loving
				environment. Because of this, they are able to express feelings and work through their difficulties
				during play, which results in healing. I love working with parents, teaching them the techniques of
				positive parenting that can lead to healthy, harmonious relationships with their children.</p>
			<h4>Working with Codependency</h4>
			<p>I enjoy working with women who want to feel empowered and to make the positive
				changes they desire in their lives. I can help you to learn to set boundaries, nurture yourself,
				and take care of your needs without guilt.</p>
			<h4>Working with Grief</h4>
				Another passion of mine is working with grief. I especially enjoy
				working with people with cancer and their family members, weather it be during the treatment process or
				when a family member has passed. It feels like an honor to be able to support someone through this
				process.</p>
			<h4>Working with Emotional Freedom technique </h4>
			<p>AWESOME</p>
