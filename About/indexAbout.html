	    <p>My passion is helping people heal. Healing comes in many forms, including emotional, spiritual,
				relational, and physical. In my experience, healing in one area affects the other areas as well.
				I use a heart centered, spiritual approach to helping others. Heart centered counseling is an
				effective and compassionate way of being with you. It helps you be able to speak from the heart,
				truly be yourself and discover the  beauty, strength, and wholeness that you already hold inside
				of you. Together we can build a strong, safe, nurturing relationship that promotes healing and well
				being.</p>
			<p>I am a Licensed Professional Counselor and have worked with adults, children and families the
				majority of my life, in all different capacities. I have training in adult, group, family, adolescent,
				child and play therapy. I work with all ages, 2 to 102! </p>
			<h4>Credentials and Experience</h4>
			<p>My education and experience include: a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Texas
				and a Master's of Education in Counseling Psychology from Texas State University, with a specialization
				in Child & Family Therapy. I was licensed as a Professional Counselor in 1999 and have helped people
				in many different capacities since that time. My experience includes private practice, a crisis
				counseling center, a shelter for abused/neglected children, a residential treatment center, a counseling
				center working with adults, families and children, as well as an owner/director/teacher of a Montessori
				preschool.</p>
			<h4>Payment</h4>
			<p>I accept private pay. If your insurance company provides out of network benefits, receipts will be given
				upon request for insurance reimbursement. I am accepting new clients and am available by appointment.</p>
